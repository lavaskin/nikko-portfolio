					<p class="text">Nikko Robledo is a Graphic Designer located in Oregon who aspires 
						to become a teacher and graduated with a BA in Visual Communication and Design. 
						Nikko had always excelled academically but would constantly 
						get caught filling his notebooks with drawings. But his teachers would rarely 
						reprimand him and would instead be encouraging which has given him a lifelong 
						love for art and education.  </p>

					<p class="text">This project tasked students with creating a campaign for a non profit organization of their choice. 
						The Marine Conservation Institute is an organization who works to preserve ocean ecosystems all over the world. 
						This redesign of the Marine Conservation Institute’s logo simplifies it to be more in line with modern logo design 
						without compromising the institute’s individuality. The icons that were created for the website’s similar shape, 
						coloring, and nautical theming aid in creating harmony between not just the icons themselves, but the 
						Marine Conservation Institute website as a whole. </p>

					<p class="text">This signage was created for Tualatin Hills Parks & Recreation to inform visitors via social media
						of the change in schedule for Labor Day. This design utilizes the red, white, and blue present on the 
						American flag to evoke the festivites that one would commonly associate with Labor day. Through THPRD I made many
					similar signs for other holidays like the 4th of July and Veteran's Day as well, all with variants to be used for either
					social media or for use in facilities.

					<p class="text">The desert landscape and vibrant colors that are utilized in this album cover serve to generate the more laid-back vibe that one would
						get from the summer season. The bold, white, stylized type on the cover stands out from the background and further clarifies the music
						 that one should expect to hear when listening to this album. </p>

					<p class="text">The slightly worn, golden design on this book immediately signals to the viewer that the 
						contents of this book are rather dark in nature. The hands creeping upwards towards a 
						crooked moon to form the odd shape of a skull in conjunction with the foreboding title generate 
						a foreboding tone. </p>

					<p class="text">This poster serves as an advertisement for the PBS documentary, The Covid Contagion. 
						The message that the coronavirus has been disproportionately affecting different racial groups 
						is the main focus of the documentary and is clearly expressed in this poster. The gloomy and 
						overall dark tone of the poster reinforces the ideas that it is trying to convey. </p>

				<div class="top">
					<img src="assets/projects/Purple Skull/purple skull.jpg" alt="Project Image" loading="lazy">
					<p class="text">This skull design incorporates bright pinks and purples that really allow it to pop and 
						gives it a very energetic feel. The combination of bright colors mingling with a dark 
						subject like a skull gives this design a bit of a punk or rebel feel which fits perfectly 
						within the skate culture allowing it to work well as a deck or clothing design. </p>

			<h1>Surreal</h1>
			<div class="project">
				<div class="top">
					<img src="assets/projects/Surreal/surreal.jpg" alt="Project Image" loading="lazy">
					<p class="text">The surrealist imagery featured in this design lends itself well to be used as the 
						cover for a magazine due to it being very bright and eye catching. The visual of 
						three faces being put together onto a single head and having a black bar over their 
						eyes to conceal their identity is a concept that works well with the topic of evaporation, 
						which is a disturbing trend in Japan in which companies help people to completely vanish 
						from their current lives and is exactly the type of story to be covered in this type of magazine. </p>

					<p class="text">The deep and saturated reds and oranges in this piece of glitch art coupled with the subject matter give
						it an almost dystopian quality. The lack of any light in the man’s eyes and the words prominently featured
						stating “You are (not) a human being” express the sentiment that many people feel in that it can often 
						times feel as though companies or even their government do not see them as individual people but instead 
						just a set of numbers. </p>

					see it and through the use of photography you can capture it.</p>
